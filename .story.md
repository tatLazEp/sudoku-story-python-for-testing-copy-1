### Generic Solution

Since kids and beginners may want to solve a four-by-four sudoku instead, it is possible for our code to solve different dimensions
of sudoku.

In the [is\_location\_valid](src/sudoku.py:48:old) function, the `used_in_box` function call has number “3” hardcoded.
This can be replaced with `SUDOKU_BOX_DIMENTION` constant.
One more place where hardcoded values are used is [here](src/sudoku.py:62:old).
That can be replaced with [this](src/sudoku.py:64).
