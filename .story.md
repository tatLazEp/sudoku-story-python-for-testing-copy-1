### Algorithm

[main\_cycle](src/sudoku.py:47-63) is the main function of the `sudoku` module.
This module contains a variable [array](src/sudoku.py:75)that represents a Sudoku table.
It [initializes this array](src/sudoku.py:75) with zeroes.
The [main\_cycle](src/sudoku.py:47) function receives the array as an argument, and tries to solve
the Sudoku recursively, ending up either with all cells filled or an error.
