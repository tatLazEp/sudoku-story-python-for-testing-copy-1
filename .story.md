### Functional Programming

The [is\_location\_valid](src/sudoku.py:42) function returns results of three function calls after storing them in variables.
Those variables are not used anywhere else. You can organize this in functional programming style [like this](src/sudoku.py:43).
It looks clean without losing the readability.

Nevertheless, Python also encourages explicit code, and if you didnâ€™t change this function, it also would be okay.
