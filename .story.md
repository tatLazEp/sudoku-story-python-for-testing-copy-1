### Main Cycle

[main\_cycle](src/sudoku.py:47) is a recursive function which first finds an empty cell by calling [find\_position\_to\_solve](src/sudoku.py:10) function, then trying out numbers
between [1 and 9](src/sudoku.py:57). This satisfies Sudoku rules by calling [check](src/sudoku.py:20) function.
This is repeated until all the cells of the puzzle are filled.
