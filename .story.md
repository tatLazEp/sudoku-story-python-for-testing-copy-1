### Obvious Renaming

While you read and try to understand the code, the easiest and the most useful thing to do is to rename some of the
variables and functions.

For example: it seems like the two-dimensional [array](src/sudoku.py:75:old) is a representation of a Sudoku table.

[main\_cycle](src/sudoku.py:47:old) is quite a strange name for a function. It does indeed contain a cycle,
and even though this cycle probably can be considered the "main cycle," the name doesn't say anything about the intention
of this function. [solve\_sudoku](src/sudoku.py:47) is much better for a name.

[check](src/sudoku.py:20:old) is also not the best name. Rename it to [is\_location\_valid](src/sudoku.py:20).

Variable [l](src/sudoku.py:48:old) doesn't mean anything; rename it to [position\_to\_fill](src/sudoku.py:48) for it to be more descriptive.

So as soon as you read the code, you can change the names of variables, fields, classes, and functions. It is simple and easy, especially using IDE.
