### Refactoring


Looking at the code, you see two big functions: [is\_location\_valid](src/sudoku.py:20) and [solve\_sudoku](src/sudoku.py:47).

[is\_location\_valid](src/sudoku.py:20) verifies that a specific number can be placed in the specific cell
while being in line with Sudoku rules. It does this by checking the proposed number in the row, the column and the box.
If the location is valid, it assigns the number to the cell and returns.
This is a clear violation of CQS (Command Query separation).
